# Traffic Light Simulator

## Description
A C++ simulation of a traffic light system with pedestrian crossings. The project models traffic light states, state transitions, and pedestrian button requests, providing a flexible framework to handle timers, display services, and customizable state behaviors. It demonstrates modern C++ design patterns, including dependency injection, state machines, and action handlers.

## Features
- Simulates traffic lights with car and pedestrian signals.  
- Handles pedestrian button requests and pending states.  
- Uses a configurable state machine for flexible traffic light behavior.  
- Supports custom display and timer services.  
- Modular architecture with separate controllers and action handlers.

## Use Case
This simulator can be used for educational purposes, testing traffic light algorithms, or as a base for more complex traffic management simulations.
